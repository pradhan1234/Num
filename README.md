Long Project 1: Num - Integer arithmetic with arbitrarily large numbers


Instructions to execute code:


The uploaded folder with name as my net id: ypp170130 contains java files "Num.java" and "BaseMismatchException.java"

NOTE: while executing from command prompt, the pwd should be the directory containing the directory ypp170130

Steps for running code from the cmd prompt

1. Compile the BaseMismatchException.java by executing the following command
> javac ypp170130/BaseMismatchException.java

2. Compile the Num.java by executing the following command
> javac ypp170130/Num.java

3. To execute the main(driver) code
> java ypp170130/Num

Sample Output:

A: 100
B: 5
Result of A/B: 20
Result of A*B: 500
Infix expression: 9/3+7-(5*1)
Result:5
